This is a project based on HTML5, CSS3 and javascript. I have done this project to learn new features introduced in HTML5 & CSS3. 

It contains .html files and .css file. To run this project. double click on index.html file. If you double on that file it will open in your default browser. I will recomment that you run it on chrome or safari browser because they support majority of new features. 

I have used twitters bootstrap framework to design this project. 

Enjoy!!!
